**READ THIS IF YOU USE AUDITORY**
Auditory and Extrasounds have a couple of conflicts. To resolve these conflicts either:

-Disable the item drop sound from the auditory config;

-Copy paste the "auditory.json" file to your configs folder.

I have also changed the config to the best fit for this pack as some sounds which may be worked on by me in the future are disabled by default
